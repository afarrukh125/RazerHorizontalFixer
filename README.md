# Razer macro tools

* Double x-coordinate to resolve issue with multiple monitors
* Remove all delays and mouse movement durations
* Collapse all mouse movement in the XML to reduce file size and number of operations
  * Can allow you to fine-tune coordinates in the resulting XML

# Key things to note

* Delays are measured in milliseconds so "3" means 0.003 on Razer UI
* The screen width does not function well with multiple monitors

# Building source
Import the `pom.xml` into IntelliJ or your chosen IDE and you can run the `Main` with
